# Heavy Neutral Lepton Decay in Flight (HNL-DIF)


### compute_constraints 

The event rate across relevent 2D parameter space is computed.

### main_plots

Plots all parameter space plots with constraints and draws the contour of event rates for our simulations

### plot_kin_distributions

Generates HNL decay events and plots several interesting kinematical variables. 

### side_checks

Computes low-level quantities like branching ratios, lifetimes, fluxes, etc.
