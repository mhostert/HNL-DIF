@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="The calorimeter was used in a search for $\nu _\mu \to \nu _e$ oscillations, where an excess was observed~\cite {Bernardi:1986hs}."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="We note that the channel $K^+ \to \mu ^+ (N \to \nu _\mu \mu ^+ \mu ^-)$ was not considered even though it also proceeds via CC diagrams and could also constrain $|U_{\mu N}|^2$."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note="We have found a similar factor in the channels $N\to \mu \pi $ and $N\to \nu e \mu $. For the latter, we find a discrepancy by a factor of 6 at the largest HNL masses, which decreases for lower HNL masses. We attribute this effect to us overestimating the signal efficiency. For $\mu \pi $, the discrepancy is a constant factor of 7.5."}
